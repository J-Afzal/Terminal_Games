# Terminal Games

Simple games that run in the terminal.

## Getting Started

Binaries can be found in [Releases](https://github.com/J-Afzal/Terminal-Games/releases) or, if preferred, CMake can be used to
build the project from source either through the PowerShell helper function:

```text
Import-Module ./modules/Build.psd1

Build-CppCodeUsingCMake -Platform windows-latest -BuildType Release -BuildDirectory build -Parallel 8 -Verbose

./build/terminal-games OR ./build/terminal-games.exe
```

or manually:

```text
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/J-Afzal/Terminal-Games.git
cd Terminal-Games
cmake -S . -B ./build -D "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release"
cmake --build ./build --config Release

./build/terminal-games OR ./build/terminal-games.exe
```

> [!WARNING]
> If on Windows make sure to add -G "NMake Makefiles" otherwise the executable may not be in the expected location.

Here are the full list of options for Terminal Games:

terminal-games options:

  --a --ascii-only  Only use extended ASCII characters (this removes all colour).
```

## General Information

There is extensive use of ANSI colour escape codes which can be toggled off on the homepage if your terminal does not support
them. All major platforms (macOS, Linux and Windows) are supported however due to the use of `Windows.h` the user experience is
much better on Windows.

### Homepage

**Feature:** Can select whether to use ANSI colour escape codes.

### Main Menu

### Quit Menu

**Feature:** Pressing the `q` key on any game screen will show the quit menu.

### Tic Tac Toe

**Supports:** 2 players (user vs user), 1 player (user vs computer) and 0 players (computer vs computer).

**Features:** The arrow keys on Windows or the `WASD` keys on other platforms can be used to navigate the board.

**Note:** The computer's choices are random.

### Hangman

**Supports:** 2 players (user vs user), 1 player (user vs computer) and 0 players (computer vs computer).

**Constraints:** The word to be guessed must be 3-16 characters long and can only contain letters. Only a single letter can be
guessed at a time.

**Features:** When guessing, you can use the up/down arrow keys on Windows or the `W`/`S` keys on other platforms to scroll
through the available letters, or press a letter key to select it (please note that pressing q here will show the quit menu).

**Note:** The computer's choices are random both when guessing letters and when selecting a word to be guessed from the
`G_HANGMAN_COMPUTER_WORDS` variable in `Globals.hpp`.

### Battleships

**Supports:** 1 player (user vs computer) and 0 players (computer vs computer).

**Features:** The arrow keys on Windows or the `WASD` on other platforms can be used to navigate the board. Selecting ship
positions can be done in either an incrementing or decrementing order with respect to the co-ordinates. Backspace on Windows or
the `Z` key on other platforms can be used to undo a ship co-ordinate selection for a ship that has not been completely placed
on the board.

**Note:** The computer's choices are random for both selecting where to place ships and where to attack.

## CI / CD

[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/J-Afzal/Terminal-Games/actions/workflows/ContinuousIntegration.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/J-Afzal/Terminal-Games/actions/workflows/ContinuousIntegration.yml)
[![Continuous Deployment](https://github.com/J-Afzal/Terminal-Games/actions/workflows/ContinuousDeployment.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/J-Afzal/Terminal-Games/actions/workflows/ContinuousDeployment.yml)

The continuous integration workflow runs against all commits on pull requests, builds the code, runs unit tests and performs
linting checks.

The continuous deployment workflow runs against all commits to main, builds the code and deploys the executables as a release.

## Development Setup

For development a few extra tools are needed to check for linting issues locally. For this clone the repo with the
[`Linters`](https://github.com/J-Afzal/Linters) submodule:

```text
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/J-Afzal/Terminal-Games.git
```

The development dependencies are:

- Git
- PowerShell version >= 5
- npm dependencies via `npm install`
- clang-tidy >= 19 and clang-format >= 19
- CMake >= 3.20
- Ninja >= 1.12.1

All linting helper functions can be found in the [`Linters`](https://github.com/J-Afzal/Linters) submodule.

### Notes

Any generator can be used to build the project but to run `clang-tidy`/`clang-format` CMake must be configured using a generator
that creates a `compile_commands.json` file in the build directory before running `clang-tidy`/`clang-format` (e.g.
`-G "Ninja"`, `-G "NMake Makefiles"`, etc)

On Windows, Visual Studio 2022 can be used by opening the folder as a CMake project and Visual Studio Code can be used by
opening the folder through the `Developer PowerShell for VS` (otherwise you may see errors around cl.exe not being found).

On windows, clang-tidy and clang-format can be installed using the `LLVM-x.x.x-win64.exe` binary from the
[LLVM release page](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-19.1.6) or from
[chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/llvm) using `choco install llvm -y`.
